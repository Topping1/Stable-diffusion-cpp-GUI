# Stable-diffusion-cpp-GUI
**Work in progress!**

Simple GUI for Stable-diffusion.cpp created with the Tkinter library. Just place alongside executable from the project [stable-diffusion.cpp](https://github.com/leejet/stable-diffusion.cpp).

## Screenshot

## Features:
- Direct editing of all options supported by Stable-diffusion.cpp (not all options implemented yet)
- Saving of last used options in `config.txt`
- Generated image is shown in GUI window (works but it is a little wonky)

## TODO:
- [] Tabbed interface to group similar options
- [x] Implement a file dialog for choosing model files
- [] Finish implementing tooltips for all options
- [] Shorten lenght of option labels
- [] Add Photomaker options

It should work on any platform that Stable-diffusion.cpp supports (not tested fully yet)
