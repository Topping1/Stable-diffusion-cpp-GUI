# Stable-diffusion-cpp-GUI
**Work in progress!**

Simple GUI for Stable-diffusion.cpp created with the Tkinter library.

Features:
- Direct editing of all options supported by Stable-diffusion.cpp (not all options implemented yet)
- Saving of last used options in `config.txt`
- Generated image is shown in GUI window (works but it is a little wonky)

TODO:
- Tabbed interface to group similar options
- Implement a file dialog for choosing model files
- TBD

It should work on any platform that Stable-diffusion.cpp supports (not tested fully yet)
